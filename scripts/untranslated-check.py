"""
Finds user-facing English still hard-coded in the app.

Run it after adding a screen: `python3 scripts/untranslated-check.py`. It reads
every `.tsx` under `apps/mobile/src`, strips comments — the prose in those is
meant to be English — and reports text a reader would see that still holds
words rather than a `t()` call.

**It has reported zero and been wrong three times, and each time the gap was
the shape of the text rather than the text itself.** Every rule below exists
because something walked past its predecessor:

1. A string alone on its line — the original check.
2. A user-facing prop. It required two words, so `overline="Utilisation"` and
   `label="Loaded"` sat on the fleet screen through a clean run.
3. Text between tags on the same line as them: `<Text>Your fleet</Text>` is
   never alone on its line.
4. Prose sharing a line with an expression. `{count} trips completed` is two
   words of English and the string is not the line, which hid roughly forty
   strings across eighteen screens.
5. A quoted string inside a JSX expression: `{held ? 'On file' : 'Not
   uploaded'}` is two labels, and every rule above blanks the braces first.
6. The middot. This product separates facts with `·` everywhere, and it was not
   in the character class, so any line using one was skipped.

It is a lint, not a gate, and it still cannot read. Proper nouns are listed in
`NAMES` because Lagos is Lagos in all four languages; a branch that is English
on purpose carries an `untranslated-check:` comment saying why.
