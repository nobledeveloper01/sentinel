# The documentation gate.
#
# Runs in pre-commit and in CI. It blocks on a document that is missing,
# malformed, or — the one that has actually bitten — present on disk and not in
# git. It warns when code has moved and the journal has not.
#
# The warning is the one that matters. It is the difference between a project
# that is documented and a project that has documentation.
