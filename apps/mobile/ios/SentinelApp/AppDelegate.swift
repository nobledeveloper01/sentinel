      The gap between the launch screen and the first React frame.

      iOS cross-fades its launch screen out as soon as the app declares itself
      launched, which is well before React has drawn anything — and what it
      fades to is the window, which is white by default. So a cold start went
      blue, pale, white, then blue again as the app's own splash arrived.

      Painting the window the same blue closes it: the launch screen fades into
      the same colour it was, and the splash takes over invisibly.

      Written out rather than read from `tokens.ts` because this runs before
      any JavaScript. `scripts/make-icons.py` and `colors.xml` carry the same
      value for the same reason, and all three say where it came from.
